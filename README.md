# LeetCode Practice

This repository is part of my commitment to improve my problem-solving skills by solving one LeetCode problem every day. Each solution is implemented in **Python** and **Java**.

## Approach

I am currently starting with all the **easy** problems first and will eventually move on to the **medium** and **hard** problems. Solutions are organized based on difficulty and programming language.

## Goals

- Develop a deeper understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- Improve problem-solving skills by consistent daily practice.
- Enhance proficiency in Python and Java programming and eventually C++
